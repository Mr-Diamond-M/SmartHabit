A complete IoT-based Smart Home Automation System built using **ESP32**, **Blynk Cloud**, and **Wokwi Simulator**.

This project demonstrates how modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can be used to remotely control household appliances through a cloud-based infrastructure. The system provides real-time control over lighting, heating, and cooling devices using an ESP32 microcontroller connected to the Blynk IoT platform.

The entire project is fully simulated using Wokwi, allowing development, testing, and demonstration without requiring physical hardware.
